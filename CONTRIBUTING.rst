Contributing code
*****************

This is an open source project, and thus relies on the generosity of its
contributors, who sacrifice their time and effort to write code and
documentation.

If you have made some changes that you think should be integrated in the main
repository, below is a short summary of the steps necessary to do so:

1. Fork the main repository (if you haven't done this already)
2. Create a branch for your work
3. Make some commits
4. Run the tests (``make test`` or ``tox``)
5. Fix any problems that the test suite revealed
6. Push the branch to your own GitHub repository fork
7. Open a pull request against this repository
8. Receive feedback in the pull request.
9. Update work according to feedback
10. The work will be merged into the main repository
